🌱 Introduction & Vision:

In the heart of Jhapa Rural Municipality, within the grounds of Shree Dilliraj Secondary School, stands our Student-Run Research Center. This independent initiative is a beacon of hope and innovation, aimed at reshaping Nepal's agricultural landscape by nurturing the ideas and ambitions of its youth.

At our research center:

Students from grade 8 and onwards are given an immersive learning experience in modern agricultural practices and experimentation.
We're actively transforming groundbreaking ideas into tangible solutions, providing mentorship, resources, and funding.
